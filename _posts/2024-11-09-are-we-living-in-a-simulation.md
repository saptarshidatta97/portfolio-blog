The idea that we could be living in a simulation is a fascinating and complex one, often known as the simulation hypothesis. It gained popularity in recent years, especially after philosopher Nick Bostrom’s 2003 paper, Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?, which proposed that one of the following must be true:

Advanced civilizations never reach the technological capability to create a realistic simulation of conscious beings.
Advanced civilizations can reach that capability, but they lose interest in creating such simulations.
We are very likely already living in such a simulation.
Bostrom's argument relies on the fact that, if it’s possible to simulate conscious beings, then advanced civilizations might run simulations of their ancestors for research, entertainment, or any other reason. If they did so on a massive scale, simulated beings (like us) would eventually outnumber those in the "base reality" – the original, non-simulated universe. In this scenario, the odds of any single consciousness being in a simulation are higher than in a base reality.

Supporters of the simulation hypothesis also point to:

Computational Limits of Physics: Physics appears to follow strict, quantifiable rules that resemble a program’s code. Some interpret this as evidence of an underlying digital structure.
Quantum Mechanics & "Reality Glitches": Quantum mechanics suggests that particles behave probabilistically until observed, which some interpret as a sort of "rendering" process, like how a simulation might not display details until necessary.
Rapid Advancements in Technology: With improvements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality, some think we might eventually create our own realistic simulations, implying that other civilizations could have done this before us.

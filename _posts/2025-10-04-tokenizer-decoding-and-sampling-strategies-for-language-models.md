title: Tokenizer Decoding and Sampling Strategies for Language Models
---


The process of generating text from an initial input involves tokenizing the text into numbers since models cannot process raw text. Tokenization converts sequences of text into numerical data and is an essential step in natural language processing (NLP).

One simple tokenization method is to break the text into individual characters, assigning each a unique numerical ID. This works well for languages like Chinese but is less efficient for languages like English. It results in a large number of tokens for even small strings, making it harder for models to capture the meaning and structure of the text. Each character carries little information, reducing accuracy and performance.

Another method is word-level tokenization, where entire words are assigned unique IDs. While this captures more meaning, it has its own challenges, such as handling unknown words (e.g., typos or slang), word variations (e.g., "run," "runs," "running"), and managing a large vocabulary that can exceed half a million words in languages like English.

Modern tokenization strategies combine the benefits of both approaches by splitting text into subwords. This allows models to efficiently capture the structure and meaning while handling unknown words and word variations. Common word parts are grouped together into a single token, while complex words or inflected forms are split into meaningful subword units.


```Python3
output_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=20)
decoded_text = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[0])

print("Input IDs", input_ids[0])
print("Output IDs", output_ids)
print(f"Generated text: {decoded_text}")
```
